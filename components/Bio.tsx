          We started at Hack Week at Square in 2013 and since then released
          hundreds of iterations, have been backed by outstanding partners like
          YCombinator, Index or Spark, and most importantly improved the way
          thousands of teams work everyday. We work remotely, perpetually
          challenge how we collaborate and we put great care and passion in what

        we do.
